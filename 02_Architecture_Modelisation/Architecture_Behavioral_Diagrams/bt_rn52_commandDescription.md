# RN52 Bluetooth communication reference and info

RN52 Bluetooth chip may be controlled and data from it get/set with a set of AT commands synthax  

For each command:
When a command is issued, RN52 module responds with an encoded 2-byte 
stream of ASCII hex data terminated by the `\r\n`

## RN52 available commands for version V1.16

## GPIOs needed for UART communication 
GPIO9
- drive GPIO9 low for CMD mode
- drive GPIO9 high for DATA mode
-> we use CMD mode only
GPIO4:  Reset to factory settings
GPIO7:  Driving this pin low sets the UART baud rate to 9,600 bps. By default the pin is high and the UART has a baud rate of 115200 bps
GPIO2:  Toggles from high to low for 100 ms to indicate that the moduleâ€™s state has changed

## UART communication 
- 115,200 Kbps
- 8 bits
- Parity: none
- Flow control: enabled (but seems to work better without)
